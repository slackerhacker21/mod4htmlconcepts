# Module 4 HTML Assignment

This repository contains the completed HTML file for the Module 4 HTML assignment, which covers essential HTML elements such as forms, tables, navigation bars, and images. The assignment demonstrates the use of various HTML5 concepts to build a simple webpage.

## Project Overview

The HTML page created in this assignment includes the following components:

- **Form Creation**: A contact form with fields for Name, Email, Message, and a group of radio buttons asking how the user found the site (Google, Social Media).
- **Table Structure**: A table displaying sample product data with columns for Product Name, Price, and Quantity.
- **Navigation Bar**: A simple navigation bar with links to Home, About, and Contact sections.
- **Images**: A placeholder image and a second image styled with a rounded border.

## Requirements

- HTML5 syntax and structure.
- Use of semantic HTML elements (`<form>`, `<nav>`, `<table>`, etc.).
- The page is designed to be responsive with the use of the viewport meta tag.
